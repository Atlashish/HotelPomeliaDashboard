![banner](./src/assets/img/Screenshot%202023-12-04%20110510.png)

# Description 📚

The site shows the dashboard of the eco-hotel Pomelia. On the left we find four boxes that describe the consumption of the hotel's solar panels; on the right, however, we find: a weather section of the weather in Rome, where the hotel is located, with underneath a counter that describes the kWh of the current day, and solar panel system logs.

# Vue.js 🟢

The website was programmed using Vue.js, a javascript framework used for creating user interfaces and single-page applications.
The program has been divided into several child components and the parent App.vue component.
